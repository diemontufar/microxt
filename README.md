Thesis Project:
Web Application for microcredit management using Sencha GXT

The aim of this thesis is to create a tool to manage the necessary processes to
commercialize microcredits. For this, firstly we plan to develop a robust platform that
leverages the benefits of using a transactional process management, modular system
architecture and the use of recent technologies in the management of persistence and
development of Java Web interfaces such as JPA and GWT respectively. With the
obtained results we pretend to give support to microcredit Assessors to carry out their
work in remote areas of the city and also getting the product to offer credits to
customers who do not have facilities for these kinds of loans through traditional means.
Microcredits are a means of development and economic growth at these sectors, which
are generally poor. The microcredit assessors require tools such as laptops,
smartphones or tablets to do their field work. This web application is intended to run on
these devices, especially laptops and tablets, making it easier for microcredit Assessors
to deal with all the process. This paper discusses the processes flow that involves
proper management of a microcredit product, as well as the organizational structure and
aspects relating to marketing, sales, and monitoring considered in that flow. Then, we
analyze topics related to the technological tools used to develop the application. We
present characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, along with statistical analysis to
justify the use of each one of them. It also addresses a formal analysis of functional
requirements of the application, to continue with the analysis, design and
implementation of the system. Finally we consider possible future works and the
conclusions drawn at the end of the project.
